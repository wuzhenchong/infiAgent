## 🌟 Introduction

**infiAgent Also called MLA (Multi-Level Agent)** is an agent framework designed for **unlimited runtime** without tool calling chaos or system crashes caused by cumulative task resources and conversation history. With MLA, you can build powerful general-purpose and semi-specialized agents simply by writing configuration files.

### Key Features

- ✅ **Days-Long Complex Tasks**: Supports continuous execution over days without context accumulation or compression degradation. Any interruption (crash, network error, manual stop) can be fully recovered via Resume — true breakpoint continuation.
- ✅ **Agent Skills Standard**: Compatible with the [Agent Skills open standard](https://agentskills.io/). Drop skill folders into the skills library and agents will discover, load, and execute them on demand.
- ✅ **Flexible Agent Architecture**: Supports both **multi-level hierarchy** (tree-structured orchestration for complex domain tasks — e.g., the `Researcher` config enables long-running scientific research with paper generation) and **flat architecture** (single agent with one sub-agent + Skills for broad general-purpose tasks — e.g., the OpenCowork config).
- ✅ **Persistent Memory**: File-directory-based memory system. Launch agents in the same workspace directory and they remember all historical tasks across sessions — no external database required.

### Update & News🔥

If you pulled the image or code before the latest update date, please refer to the issues that have been fixed and, based on your needs, pull the image and code again.

- [2026/03/31] **Switchable Thinking / ReAct execution mode + task-history database retrieval:** Runtime now supports a switchable cadence model. You can keep the original ThinkingAgent-style “plan first, then execute N steps” workflow, or disable thinking and fall back to an explicit ReAct loop where reflection text is persisted directly inside the message history. Historical task records are also indexed into a local SQLite database, and agents now get a built-in `task_history_search` tool by default. The SDK can expose only the most recent N historical tasks into prompt context, and agents are explicitly instructed to retrieve older task history from the database when recent context is not enough.

- [2026/03/30] **SDK / mac / Web UI model configuration is now much easier for non-experts:** The SDK now accepts structured model profiles directly instead of forcing every integration to hand-write `llm_config.yaml`. The mac desktop app and Docker Web UI both now expose a source-based model editor: you configure the default `base_url` / `api_key` once, then add multiple shared or per-slot models, and each row can either reuse the default source or switch to a custom URL / key. Raw YAML / JSON remain available as advanced fallbacks, but most users no longer need to manually type prefixes or JSON model objects.

- [2026/03/23] **Docker Web UI now supports multi-user registration and account management:** The latest `chenglinhku/mlav3:latest` image runs the SDK-based Web UI directly with the new `webui` startup command on port `4242`. Users can register from the login page, and the bootstrap admin account can manage users inside the Web UI. Please follow the updated Docker command in Quick Start / `docs/DOCKER_GUIDE.md`: mount `~/.mla_v3` to `/root/mla_v3`, publish `4242`, and use `chenglinhku/mlav3:latest webui`. The old standalone config page flow on `9641` is no longer required.

- [2026/03/19] **CheapClaw released on top of the `infiagent` SDK:** CheapClaw now ships as an SDK-based application layer. It keeps most of OpenCowork's practical capabilities, including custom bots, multi-bot collaboration workflows, IM integrations, and Skills, while inheriting the full `infiagent` runtime model: a multi-agent system behind a single bot, low-cost long-horizon tasks, and task-scoped context isolation inside one bot. Different tasks under the same bot now keep isolated contexts, while messages routed to the same task continue in the same long-running context instead of sharing one bot-wide session. [Click here to view CheapClaw](https://github.com/polyuiislab/CheapClaw).

- [2026/03/19] **Finer-grained per-agent model configuration:** Each sub-agent can now configure `execution_model`, `thinking_model`, `compressor_model`, `image_generation_model`, and `read_figure_model` independently. This makes it possible, within a single agent loop, to split execution, thinking, compression, and multimodal/image understanding across different models, giving the application layer the finest-grained cost control. You can also configure model-level `tool_choice` options in `llm_config.example.yaml`. See the default `OpenCowork` Level 3 `alpha_agent` definition for a concrete example.

- [2026/03/08] **Desktop branch sync update:** The current desktop branch now includes packaged Python backend build scripts, the bundled `infiagent` Python SDK, configurable runtime cadence (`action_window_steps`, `thinking_interval`, scheduled/manual `fresh`), MCP runtime integration, per-task logs, desktop environment settings, and marketplace integration. The legacy standalone tool-server workflow has been replaced by in-process `direct-tools`, and the built-in research system is now named `Researcher`.

- [2026/02/09] **Mac desktop version released!** [Click here to download!](https://github.com/polyuiislab/infiAgent/releases/tag/MAC_OS_V1.1.0). Support download skills from offical market. It supports any API that is allowed to be called by tools, and runs fully locally with the support of the localization model.

- [2026/02/07] **Agent Skills Support!** InfiAgent now supports the [Agent Skills open standard](https://agentskills.io/). Skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that agents can dynamically load to improve performance on specialized tasks. Docker users: place skill folders in `~/.mla_v3/skills_library/` (mounted to `/root/mla_v3/skills_library/` inside the container). Local developers: place them in `~/mla_v3/skills_library/`. Windows users: `%USERPROFILE%\mla_v3\skills_library\`. The agent will automatically discover available skills and deploy them to the workspace on demand via `load_skill` tool.

- [2026/02/07] **Multi-Provider Model Support!** You can now use models from different providers in the same configuration. Each model can optionally override `api_key` and `base_url` to use a different provider. Different sub-agents can use different models. See `llm_config.example.yaml` for configuration details.

- [2026/02/07] **Web UI Enhancements:** Added Resume button for recovering interrupted tasks (same as CLI `/resume`). Added Agent System selector to freely switch between `Researcher` (academic research) and Open Cowork systems. User inputs now automatically include timestamps (consistent with CLI behavior).

- [2026/02/07] **Multimodal Message Architecture:** Separated multimodal and text-only message logic. For multimodal models, images from `image_read` are embedded directly in the conversation context for native understanding. Text-only models retain the external vision tool approach. Configure via `multimodal` and `compressor_multimodal` in `llm_config.yaml`.

- [2026/01/17] We introduce a new configuration profile, Open Cowork, which delivers a computer-work assistant similar to Anthropic's Cowork. After entering a user-specified working directory, the assistant can perform a wide range of tasks, including but not limited to: organizing folders, creating PowerPoint presentations, processing and categorizing bills and invoices in multiple formats, conducting in-depth research, and writing project code. The system is built on the InfiAgent architecture, preserving its long-horizon execution capabilities and unbounded, file-system–level memory within the same workspace. Open Cowork supports CLI, Docker-based CLI, and Web UI modes. In Web UI, use the Agent System selector to switch between `Researcher` and OpenCowork. A demonstration video is available for more details.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Vedio of Docker Mode:

<a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV142vQB2EDu/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=8f099df5d40b73e936381e57d7fc05aa
">infiagent:全自动写作工具</a>

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended - No Python Required)

**1. Install Docker**
- Mac/Windows: [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- Linux: `curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh`

**2. Pull Image**

```bash
docker pull chenglinhku/mlav3:latest
```

**3. Choose Your Mode**

### Option A: Web UI Mode (Recommended)

The current Docker image starts the SDK-based Web UI directly. Use the Agent System selector to switch between `Researcher` and `OpenCowork`. The old standalone config page on `9641` is no longer required.

```bash
cd /your/workspace
mkdir -p ~/.mla_v3

docker run -d --name mla-webui \
  -e HOST_PWD=$(pwd) \
  -e PORT=4242 \
  -v $(pwd):/workspace$(pwd) \
  -v ~/.mla_v3:/root/mla_v3 \
  -p 4242:4242 \
  chenglinhku/mlav3:latest webui
```

Then open browser: `http://localhost:4242`

- On a fresh volume, the bootstrap admin account is `admin` / `admin123`
- You can also create a new user directly from the login page
- Click the `Config` button inside Web UI to edit `llm_config.yaml`, `app_config.json`, and agent configuration files
- View logs with `docker logs -f mla-webui`

If you want Docker runtime data to stay inside the project instead of `~/.mla_v3`, replace the runtime mount with:

```bash
mkdir -p .mla_v3_docker
# replace: -v ~/.mla_v3:/root/mla_v3
# with:    -v $(pwd)/.mla_v3_docker:/root/mla_v3
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/web_ui.png" alt="Paper Generation Demo 2" width="800">
</p>

📖 **Web UI usage & UI details**: see [web_ui/README.md](web_ui/README.md).

### Option B: CLI Mode

```bash
cd /your/workspace
mkdir -p ~/.mla_v3

docker run -it --rm \
  -e HOST_PWD=$(pwd) \
  -v $(pwd):/workspace$(pwd) \
  -v ~/.mla_v3:/root/mla_v3 \
  chenglinhku/mlav3:latest cli
```

**Windows Users:**

Windows users can mount any working folder into `/workspace/<your_task_root>` and reuse the same `/root/mla_v3` runtime volume across runs.

```powershell
# CLI Mode (PowerShell)
docker run -it --rm `
  -e HOST_PWD="/docker_web" `
  -v "${PWD}:/workspace/docker_web" `
  -v "${HOME}\.mla_v3:/root/mla_v3" `
  chenglinhku/mlav3:latest cli

# Web UI Mode (PowerShell)
docker run -d --name mla-webui `
  -e HOST_PWD="/docker_web" `
  -e PORT=4242 `
  -v "${PWD}:/workspace/docker_web" `
  -v "${HOME}\.mla_v3:/root/mla_v3" `
  -p 4242:4242 `
  chenglinhku/mlav3:latest webui

# Then open browser: http://localhost:4242
# View logs: docker logs -f mla-webui
```

**4. Configure API Key**

Open browser: `http://localhost:4242`

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/config_web_screen_shot.png" alt="Configuration Web Interface" width="800">
</p>

Sign in, open the `Config` dialog, edit `llm_config.yaml`, fill in your API key, and save.

**🎉 Done!** Start using MLA CLI.

## 🎯 How It Works

MLA's design philosophy is **"Provide short but high-value context for the next step."** To achieve this, the framework implements multiple innovations:

### 1. 🌲 Serial Multi-Agent System

MLA deploys agents in a **tree-structured hierarchy** (e.g., Grandparent → Parent → Child). This ensures:

- ✅ **Single-purpose agents**: Each agent has a focused role
- ✅ **Minimal tool sets**: Agents only access necessary tools
- ✅ **Task alignment**: Serial execution prevents parallel conflicts
- ✅ **Clear delegation**: Parent agents orchestrate child agents

**Example Hierarchy:**
```
alpha_agent (Level 3)
  ├── data_collection_agent (Level 2)
  │   └── web_search_agent (Level 1)
  ├── coder_agent (Level 2)
  └── material_to_document_agent (Level 2)
```

### 2. 🎯 Nested Attention Mechanism

Long documents (PDFs, novels, papers) are **never directly loaded into context**. Instead:

- ✅ Use `answer_from_pdf`, `answer_from_document` tools
- ✅ Query-driven content extraction
- ✅ Only relevant excerpts or summaries enter context
- ✅ **Application-layer attention allocation** through tools

**Traditional Approach:**
```
Load entire 50-page PDF → Agent processes everything → Token overflow
```

**MLA Approach:**
```
Agent asks: "What is the methodology?"
→ Tool extracts relevant sections (2 pages)
→ Returns concise answer → Minimal token usage
```

### 3. 📁 File-Centric Architecture

**"Files are everything."** All outputs and interactions are saved to the file system:

- ✅ Web scraping → Saves as Markdown files
- ✅ PDF parsing → Extracts to structured documents
- ✅ Sub-agent results → Stored as files
- ✅ **No immediate returns** cluttering context

**Benefits:**
- Clear audit trail
- Reusable artifacts
- Context-free state representation

### 4. ⚡ Ten-Step Strategy (No Context Compression)

A key insight: **The current file system state represents the effect of all historical actions.**

- ✅ A separate **thinking module** updates file space state every 30 steps
- ✅ Agents only retain **the last 10 actions** (since last state update)
- ✅ **No need for context compression**
- ✅ Historical actions are reflected in file system, not conversation history

**Traditional LLM Agents:**
```
Step 1: Create file A
Step 2: Edit file B
...
Step 100: Context overflow → Compression needed → Information loss
```

**MLA Approach:**
```
Steps 1-10: Actions recorded
Step 10: Thinking module updates "Current State: Files A, B, C exist with..."
Steps 11-20: Only these + Current State kept
→ No compression, no information loss
```

### 5. 🔧 Batch File Operations

Inspired by [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/), MLA uses **list-based tool parameters** to save tokens:

- ✅ Read multiple files in one call
- ✅ Batch operations reduce cumulative overhead
- ✅ Significant token savings on repeated actions

**Example:**
```python
# Traditional: 3 separate calls
file_read(path="file1.txt")
file_read(path="file2.txt")
file_read(path="file3.txt")

# MLA: 1 batch call
file_read(paths=["file1.txt", "file2.txt", "file3.txt"])
```

### 6. 💾 Long-Term Memory with Task ID

- ✅ **Task ID = Workspace absolute path** (not user-configurable)
- ✅ Same task ID allows **unlimited conversation sessions**
- ✅ Agents remember all historical tasks in the workspace
- ✅ Persistent memory across interruptions and restarts

**Usage:**
```bash
# First session
mla-agent --task_id ~/research --user_input "Collect papers on Transformers"
# → Stores conversation in ~/mla_v3/conversations/{hash}_research_*

# Second session (days later)
mla-agent --task_id ~/research --user_input "Summarize the collected papers"
# → Agent remembers previous session and accesses collected files
```

### 7. 📊 Call Graph-Based Shared Context

The `hierarchy_manager` maintains a **dynamic call relationship graph**:

- ✅ Tracks parent-child agent relationships
- ✅ Injects call graph into shared context
- ✅ Prevents agents from overstepping boundaries
- ✅ Maintains task alignment across multi-agent system

**Call Graph Example:**
```json
{
  "current_agent": "coder_agent",
  "parent": "alpha_agent",
  "siblings": ["data_collection_agent", "material_to_document_agent"],
  "allowed_tools": ["python_run", "file_write", "file_read"]
}
```

This ensures `coder_agent` won't accidentally call `web_search` (not in its scope) or interfere with sibling agents.

## ⚙️ Configuration Guide

MLA uses YAML files for agent and tool configuration. Configuration files are located in:

```
config/
├── agent_library/
│   ├── Researcher/                 # Research-oriented multi-level system
│   │   ├── general_prompts.yaml    # Shared prompts
│   │   ├── level_-1_judge_agent.yaml  # Judge agent
│   │   ├── level_0_tools.yaml      # Tool definitions
│   │   ├── level_1_agents.yaml     # Low-level agents
│   │   ├── level_2_agents.yaml     # Mid-level agents
│   │   └── level_3_agents.yaml     # Top-level agents
│   └── OpenCowork/                 # General computer-work assistant
└── run_env_config/
    ├── llm_config.yaml             # LLM settings
    └── llm_config.example.yaml     # Example template
```

### Key Configuration Files

#### 1. `llm_config.yaml` - LLM Configuration

```yaml
# Global defaults
api_key: "your-api-key"
base_url: "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
temperature: 0
max_tokens: 0

models:
  - openai/google/gemini-3-flash-preview     # uses global api_key + base_url
  - name: openai/qwen-plus                    # override with different provider
    api_key: "your-dashscope-key"
    base_url: "https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1"

figure_models:
  - openai/google/gemini-3-flash-preview
compressor_models:
  - openai/google/gemini-3-flash-preview
thinking_models:
  - openai/google/gemini-3-flash-preview
read_figure_models:
  - openai/google/gemini-3-flash-preview

# Multimodal configuration
multimodal: true              # Enable image embedding in messages for main model
compressor_multimodal: true   # Enable image embedding for compressor model
```

**Note**: Copy `llm_config.example.yaml` to `llm_config.yaml` to get started. Each model can optionally override `api_key` and `base_url` to use a different provider.

#### 2. Agent Hierarchy

MLA organizes agents into levels:

- **Level 3**: Top-level orchestrators (e.g., `alpha_agent`)
- **Level 2**: Functional specialists (e.g., `data_collection_agent`, `coder_agent`)
- **Level 1**: Basic executors (e.g., `web_search_agent`)
- **Level 0**: Tool definitions
- **Level -1**: Quality control (e.g., `judge_agent`)

#### 3. Creating Custom Agents

Edit YAML files to customize agent behavior:

```yaml
news_agent:
  type: llm_call_agent
  level: 1
  model_type: "advanced"
  available_tools:
    - data_collection_agent
    - coder_agent
    ...
  system_prompt: |
    You are a newspaper agent.
```

| `--force-new` | Clear all state and start fresh | `false` |
| `--auto-mode` | Tool execution mode (`true`/`false`) | Auto-detect |

**Auto-Mode Examples:**

```bash
# Automatic tool execution (no confirmation needed)
mla-agent --task_id ~/project --user_input "Task" --auto-mode true

# Manual confirmation for each tool
mla-agent --task_id ~/project --user_input "Task" --auto-mode false
```

---

### Runtime Tool Execution

```bash
# Tools are executed in-process through direct-tools.
# No standalone mla-tool-server process is required.
```

---

## 🔌 SDK Integration

MLA provides two SDK options: **Python SDK** for direct integration and **JSONL mode** for IDE plugins.

---

### Python SDK

Use the bundled `infiagent` SDK. The current SDK model is:

- instantiate `infiagent(...)` once to describe runtime defaults
- pass a concrete `task_id` to `run(...)` and other task APIs
- optionally point the whole runtime at a dedicated `user_data_root`

Minimal example:

```python
from infiagent import infiagent

agent = infiagent(
    user_data_root="/abs/path/to/my_root",
    default_agent_system="Researcher",
    default_agent_name="alpha_agent",
    action_window_steps=30,
    thinking_interval=30,
    max_turns=100000,
    fresh_enabled=True,
    fresh_interval_sec=300,
)

result = agent.run(
    "Write a survey paper on Transformers",
    task_id="/abs/path/to/tasks/transformer_survey",
)

print(f"Status: {result['status']}")
print(f"Output: {result['output']}")
```

If your `user_data_root` already contains:

- `config/llm_config.yaml`
- `config/app_config.json`
- `agent_library/...`
- `tools_library/...`

you usually do not need to pass `llm_config_path`, `agent_library_dir`, or `tools_dir` again.

Common task APIs:

```python
# Ask a running or stopped task to refresh runtime config.
agent.fresh(
    task_id="/abs/path/to/tasks/transformer_survey",
    reason="reload runtime config",
)

# Append a new instruction to the same task.
agent.add_message(
    "Keep the existing outline and only revise section 3.",
    task_id="/abs/path/to/tasks/transformer_survey",
    source="user",
    resume_if_needed=True,
)

# Launch a separate background task in another Python process.
agent.start_background_task(
    task_id="/abs/path/to/tasks/subtask_eval",
    user_input="Run the evaluation pipeline and summarize results",
    force_new=True,
)

# Inspect task state for dashboards or lightweight watchdogs.
snapshot = agent.task_snapshot(
    task_id="/abs/path/to/tasks/transformer_survey",
)

# Reset a broken task loop while optionally preserving history.
agent.reset_task(
    task_id="/abs/path/to/tasks/transformer_survey",
    reason="clear broken loop",
    preserve_history=True,
)
```

Runtime introspection:

```python
runtime = agent.describe_runtime()
print(runtime["user_data_root"])
print(runtime["agent_library_dir"])
print(runtime["tools_dir"])

systems = agent.list_agent_systems()
print(systems["systems"])
```

Advanced runtime features supported by the SDK:

- task-scoped background execution and resume/fresh control
- `user_data_root`-scoped conversations, logs, runtime state, and config
- tool hooks before/after tool execution
- context hooks that can inspect or rewrite the final prompt before the LLM call
- per-instance MCP server injection through `mcp_servers=[...]`

See the full guide: [docs/SDK_GUIDE.md](/Users/chenglin/Desktop/research/agent_framwork/vscode_version/MLA_V3/docs/SDK_GUIDE.md)

**Use Cases for Python SDK:**
- 🔧 Building custom workflows
- 🤖 Embedding agents in existing applications
- 📊 Batch processing multiple tasks
- 🧭 Building external dashboards, watchdogs, and orchestration layers
- 🔬 Research experiments with programmatic control

### JSONL Mode for IDE Plugins

MLA provides a JSONL streaming mode for real-time integration with IDEs and editors:

```bash
mla-agent \
  --task_id $(pwd) \
  --user_input "Optimize code performance" \
  --jsonl 2>/dev/null
```

**Output Format:**

```jsonl
{"type":"start","call_id":"c-1760936557-474c43","project":"~/project","agent":"alpha_agent","task":"Optimize..."}
{"type":"token","text":"[alpha_agent] Analyzing code..."}
{"type":"progress","phase":"execution","pct":30}
{"type":"token","text":"Calling tool: code_analyzer"}
{"type":"result","ok":true,"summary":"Optimization complete"}
{"type":"end","status":"ok","duration_ms":5432}
```

**Event Types:**

| Event Type | Description | Key Fields |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| `start` | Task begins | `call_id`, `agent`, `task` |
| `token` | Streaming text output | `text` |
| `progress` | Progress update | `phase`, `pct` |
| `result` | Task result | `ok`, `summary` |
| `end` | Task completed | `status`, `duration_ms` |
| `error` | Error occurred | `message` |

---

### TypeScript/JavaScript Integration

```typescript
import { spawn } from 'child_process';

interface AgentEvent {
  type: 'start' | 'token' | 'progress' | 'result' | 'end' | 'error';
  [key: string]: any;
}

function runAgent(
  workspacePath: string,
  userInput: string,
  onEvent: (event: AgentEvent) => void
): Promise<AgentEvent> {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  const child = spawn('mla-agent', [
    '--task_id', workspacePath,
    '--user_input', userInput,
    '--jsonl'
  ]);
  
    let buffer = '';
    
  child.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
      buffer += data.toString();
      const lines = buffer.split('\n');
      buffer = lines.pop() || '';
      
      lines.forEach(line => {
      if (!line.trim()) return;
      
        try {
          const event: AgentEvent = JSON.parse(line);
          onEvent(event);
          
          if (event.type === 'end') {
            resolve(event);
          } else if (event.type === 'error') {
            reject(new Error(event.message));
          }
        } catch (e) {
          console.error('Failed to parse event:', line);
    }
  });
});

    child.stderr.on('data', (data) => {
      // Log errors to stderr
      console.error(data.toString());
    });
    
    child.on('error', reject);
  });
}

// Usage
await runAgent('/path/to/workspace', 'Write unit tests', (event) => {
      switch (event.type) {
        case 'start':
      console.log(`Task started: ${event.task}`);
          break;
        case 'token':
      process.stdout.write(event.text);
      break;
    case 'progress':
      updateProgressBar(event.pct);
          break;
        case 'result':
      console.log(`\nResult: ${event.summary}`);
          break;
      }
    });
```
